One day I ate lunch at the memorial union. It was covered in pictures of paul Bunyun. 
I ordered a delicious sandwhich of turkey and avacado and bacon.
It was bettery and good
I also got a soup. I t was also good

I was alive that day. Really, truly alive. It's so rare those days happen anymore.
I hope another comes soon.
