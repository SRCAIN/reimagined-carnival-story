One day I ate lunch at the memorial union. It was covered in pictures of paul Bunyun. 
I ordered a delicious sandwhich of turkey and avacado and bacon.
It was bettery and good
I also got a soup. I t was also good

I was alive that day. Really, truly alive. It's so rare those days happen anymore.
I hope another comes soon. 

It's so easy that my dream came true in day after that.

Eventually the dream came to and end and what I saw when I awoke terrified me.
It was a walking nightmare from the deepest, darkest, pits of my imagination.

It was homework, terrible, terrible homework. It lurched at me and with a single
 swing of my sword, It was all dead. I had done it!
